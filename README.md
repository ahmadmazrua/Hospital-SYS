> 3.	Normal patient is added to the end of the current queue of this specialization
> 4.	Urgent patient is added after current urgents patients & before normal patients
> 5.	Super-urgent patient is added after current super-urgent patients & before urgent/normal patients
> 6.	Read the requested specialization [1-20]
> 7.	Read his name and status (0 = regular, 1 urgent)
> 8.	If 10 patients exist in this specialization, apologize and donâ€™t accept
